#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

a= "apples" 
b= "bananas" 
x=(a==b)
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

e=(3==3)
print(e)
#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
c=(4>3)
print(c)


#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
d=(5<2)
print(d)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
f=(6>=5)
print(f)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
g=(9<=9)
print(g)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
o="Dos" 
p="dogs"
j=(o==p)
