#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x= "Basket " + "ball"
print(x)
#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

b= 3 + 4
print(b)
#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

c= 10 - 5
print(c)
#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
d= 7.3 - 4.3
print(d)
#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

g= 6 * 4
print(g)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
h= "Dogs " * 4
print(h)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
q= 8 / 2
print(q)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
y= 4.5 / 2.5
print(y)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
v= 5 % 10
print(v)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
k= 7 // 9
print(k)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
p= 3 ** 2
print (p)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error
