#EX) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
one = True
two = False
a = one and two 
print(a)

#1) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
leg = True
arm = True
a= leg and arm 
print(a)



#2) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the or operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named b. Print the variable.
one = True 
two = False 
b = one or two 
print(b)


#3) Make one boolean variable. Put the variable after the not. Store this 
#expression in a variable named c. Print the variable.
c = not 3 == 3 
print(c) 


#4) Make a logical expression with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

#messing up the comparison. I want the statement to be true.
dog = 1
cat = 2
d= dog and cat 
print(d) 

# the and should be changed to an or for this statement to be true.
