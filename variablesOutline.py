#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

a = 5
a = 3.45
a = "Samantha"
a = True
a = [1,2,3,4]
#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)
varA = 1
vara = 2

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
var = 5

var = "string"

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

var = varA

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

list = [1,2,3,4]
var = (list[1])

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:

string = "Abrielle"
var = "string[0]"

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print (var)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errorss
#string = abrielle
#no ""
